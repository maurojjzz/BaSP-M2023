#  Become a Software Professional 2023 üöÄ

## Week 01
We had to do a screenflow using Figma based on a GYM "Mega Rocket SA". 

The screenflow needs to have a responsive landing page for three differents types of screens (iPhone 13 Pro / iPad Pro 11 / MacBookPro 14). And then a bunch of different functions for all 4 roles the system would have. Roles as Admin, Super Admin, Trainer, Member.

The final result: https://www.figma.com/file/5kIcKaOXyFotW6ON4sodGu/UI-kit-RR---A?node-id=701%3A367&t=ed2iszyGhiVgOCSJ-1



## Week 02
Create an HTML file with the same content as the landing page made in week 01 with Figma using the desktop view as prototype.

## Week 03
Based on the week 01's screenflow we have to take as reference the landing page to give it styles on CSS using week 2 HTML project. This week CSS project shouldn't be responsive and the challenge is to solve it using a 1512px width screen.

## Week 04 
The problematic in week 04 was to make a responsive web desing following the concept of Mobile First  based in last weeks materials (Figma, HTML and CSS). We had to adapt the web page using as reference three specific devices measures:
- iPhone (390px width) 
- iPad (834px width)
