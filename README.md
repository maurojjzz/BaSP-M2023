#  Become a Software Professional 2023 ðŸš€

## Week 01
We had to do a screenflow using Figma based on a GYM "Mega Rocket SA". 

The screenflow needs to have a responsive landing page for three differents types of screens (iPhone 13 Pro / iPad Pro 11 / MacBookPro 14). And then a bunch of different functions for all 4 roles the system would have. Roles as Admin, Super Admin, Trainer, Member.

The final result: https://www.figma.com/file/5kIcKaOXyFotW6ON4sodGu/UI-kit-RR---A?node-id=701%3A367&t=ed2iszyGhiVgOCSJ-1



## Week 02
Create an HTML file with the same content as the landing page made in week 01 with Figma using the desktop view as prototype.
